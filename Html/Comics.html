<h1>Ranking of My Favorites</h1>
<h2>3. Absolute Superman </h2>
<p>Jason Aaron reinvents Superman by altering his backstory so he was raised on krypton, experiencing the classism and greed that destroyed the planet. This gives him further motivation stop the same from happening on earth. The story provide something unique with Superman being a champion of the oppressed.</p>

<h2>2. Invincible</h2>
<p>This comic is a beautiful love letter to the superhero comic genre while not having the limitations of Marvel and DC. The story is allowed to permantly develop with changes like villains winning without backtracking and characters dying without revival. It was a exceptional comic and I still remember bingeing all 144 issues in three sittings.</p>

<h2>1. Ultimates (2024)</h2>
<p>Deniz Camp uses the set-up from 2023's Ultimate Invasion, which introducing a villain controlled world with no heroes, to a team of characters who's goal is to take back their world from those who changed it. The Ultimates establish themselves as revolutionaires comprised of both orignal heroes and new legacy heroes. It uses its concept well in a superhero context as the team grows and develops their movement to fit the needs of the people, eventually becomes the flame that burns the empire.</p>
